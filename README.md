# Grid-files-implementation

Developing an implementation of Grid files for storing 2-dimensional data points.
Each data point in the dataset is a triple defined as follows: <id> <x-coordinate> <y-coordinate>. Here <id> is a unique number between 1 and number-points-in-dataset. 
Simulating Buckets:
Buckets are to be implemented as text files in your code. Bucket size is defined as the number of data points it can accommodate. For instance, if the bucket-size is defined to be 30, it means that the file simulating the bucket can store 30 data records.
  
 Grid is implemented using linkedlists. One main linkedlist and from its nodes sub linkedlists arise and form a 2d matrix like structure in total.
